# Location Report: Library (Crime Scene)

## Description

Richard Thornwood's private library, located on the ground floor of Thornwood Manor. The room measures approximately 8m x 6m and contains his most valuable private art collection.

## Access Points

1. **Main Door**: Opens to the central hallway. This door was closed when the body was discovered.
2. **French Doors**: Glass-paneled doors leading to the side garden. These doors can be opened from outside with a simple latch - no key required.

## Layout

- Large mahogany desk positioned facing the French doors
- Leather armchair behind desk
- Built-in bookshelves on three walls
- Four pedestals displaying sculptures, including the murder weapon's original position near the French doors
- Persian rug covering most of the floor
- Single overhead chandelier plus desk lamp

## Crime Scene Findings

### Body Position
Victim found face-down, 1 meter from his desk. He had been facing the desk (back to French doors) when struck.

### Evidence Markers
- **A**: Murder weapon (bronze sculpture) - 1.5m from body
- **B**: Wine glass on desk with lipstick traces
- **C**: Torn letter fragments on desk
- **D**: Open folder with legal documents
- **E**: Mud traces near French doors

### Disturbance
Minimal. No signs of struggle or ransacking. The attack was swift and unexpected.

### French Doors
Found unlocked. No signs of forced entry. Muddy footprint (partial) found on exterior step.

## Key Observations

1. The victim was comfortable enough to turn his back to the French doors, suggesting he either didn't know someone was there or knew and trusted them.

2. The sculpture used as the murder weapon was positioned near the French doors - convenient for someone entering from the garden.

3. The wine glass on the desk suggests the victim may have shared a drink with his killer before the attack.

4. Legal documents on the desk were related to the Carol Thompson lawsuit, suggesting this matter was on his mind that evening.

## Investigator Theory

The killer entered through the French doors from the garden, picked up the sculpture, and struck while Richard was examining documents at his desk. The presence of the wine glass and lipstick suggests a woman who Richard knew - he willingly shared wine with her before being attacked.

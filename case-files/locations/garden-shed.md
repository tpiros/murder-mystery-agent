# Location Report: Garden Shed

## Description

Small wooden outbuilding located in the rear garden of Thornwood Manor. Used for storing gardening equipment and outdoor furniture during winter.

## Relevance to Case

The garden shed was searched as part of the standard investigation. While not directly connected to the murder, an important discovery was made.

## Discovery

### Item Found
A navy blue cardigan, women's size medium, hidden under a tarp with gardening supplies.

### Condition
- Slightly damp from the evening's rain
- Small tear on the left sleeve
- Navy thread missing from the torn area

### Significance
The torn navy thread found on the murder weapon matches this cardigan's fabric. Laboratory analysis confirms identical fiber composition.

### Ownership
The cardigan has a dry-cleaning tag from "Premier Cleaners" on Main Street. Records show this cardigan was dropped off and picked up by Carol Thompson.

## Other Findings

- Fresh footprints leading to and from the shed, consistent with women's heeled shoes
- No fingerprints on the shed door handle (wiped clean)
- Disturbed dust pattern suggests recent activity

## Timeline Reconstruction

Based on evidence, it appears someone:
1. Entered the shed after the rain (damp cardigan)
2. Removed or deposited the cardigan
3. Wiped the door handle
4. Left via the garden path toward the house

## Investigator Notes

This discovery is significant. The navy thread on the murder weapon matches Carol Thompson's cardigan, which was hidden in the garden shed. This suggests:
1. Carol wore this cardigan during the murder
2. The thread caught on the weapon when she swung it
3. She hid the cardigan to destroy evidence
4. Her claim of never going outside is contradicted

Combined with the muddy shoes, wine glass lipstick, torn letter, and witness testimony, this creates a compelling chain of evidence pointing to Carol Thompson.

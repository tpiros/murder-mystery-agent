# Suspect Profile: Bob Martinez

## Personal Information
- **Age**: 34
- **Occupation**: Unemployed, former restaurant owner
- **Relationship to Victim**: Nephew (sister's son)

## Financial Situation

Bob's restaurant failed 18 months ago, leaving him with significant debt. He has been living off a small monthly allowance from his uncle Richard, who frequently threatened to cut him off.

## Motive Assessment

**Financial**: Primary beneficiary in Richard's will - stands to inherit approximately $15 million
**Personal**: Richard often belittled Bob publicly, calling him a "failure" and threatening to disinherit him

## Alibi

Claims he stepped outside at 9:10 PM to smoke in the garden. Says he walked around for about 25 minutes before returning at 9:35 PM.

## Alibi Issues

- No witnesses to confirm his presence in the garden
- The garden path passes near the library's French doors
- He was seen returning with mud on his shoes

## Statement

"Uncle Richard and I had our problems, but he was family. Sure, the inheritance is nice, but I didn't know the will had been updated. I went outside because the tension at dinner was unbearable. Carol and Uncle Richard kept giving each other death stares."

## Physical Evidence

Mud on his shoes consistent with the garden path. However, forensic analysis shows the mud pattern is from the front garden, not the side path near the library.

## Investigator Notes

Bob appeared nervous throughout questioning but seemed genuinely surprised about being the primary beneficiary. His gambling debts (discovered during investigation) give him strong financial motive, but the mud evidence actually supports his alibi of being in the front garden.

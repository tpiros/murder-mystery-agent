# Suspect Profile: David Kim

## Personal Information
- **Age**: 29
- **Occupation**: Former personal assistant to victim (recently terminated)
- **Relationship to Victim**: Employee (fired one week prior)

## Employment History

David worked as Richard's personal assistant for 5 years. He was abruptly fired one week before the murder. Richard gave no clear reason, only saying David had "betrayed his trust."

## Financial Situation

David was well-compensated during his employment but had no savings due to supporting his mother's medical treatments. Losing his job put him in a desperate situation.

## Motive Assessment

**Financial**: Lost his income suddenly with no severance
**Personal**: Felt betrayed after 5 years of loyal service
**Unknown Factor**: The reason for his firing remains unclear

## Alibi

Claims he came to collect personal belongings and discuss severance. Says he was in the kitchen area talking to the housekeeper between 9:00 PM and 9:30 PM, then left through the back door.

## Alibi Issues

- Housekeeper confirms he was in the kitchen until about 9:20 PM
- She then went to check on the dining room, losing sight of him
- He was seen leaving at 9:30 PM
- That leaves a 10-minute window unaccounted for

## Statement

"Mr. Thornwood fired me without explanation. I gave him five years of my life. I came that night to ask for severance and a reference letter. When Margaret went to check the dining room, I decided to wait, then gave up and left. I never went near the library."

## Physical Evidence

None directly linking him to the scene.

## Investigator Notes

David's story about the firing is corroborated - Richard told the housekeeper that David had "disappointed him greatly" but never specified how. David appeared more sad than angry during questioning. His 10-minute gap is concerning but short for committing murder and cleaning up.

**Important Discovery**: Investigation revealed David had discovered Carol Thompson was paying a staff member at Richard's gallery to leak information about the lawsuit. David reported this to Richard the day before he was fired - but Richard accused David of being the leak instead.

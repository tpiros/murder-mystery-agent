# Suspect Profile: Carol Thompson

## Personal Information
- **Age**: 55
- **Occupation**: Art gallery owner, former business partner of victim
- **Relationship to Victim**: Ex-business partner, currently in litigation

## Background

Carol and Richard were partners in the Thornwood Gallery for 15 years before a bitter split 3 years ago. She accused Richard of defrauding her of her share; he counter-sued for defamation. The case has been in courts ever since.

## Financial Situation

The ongoing legal battle has depleted much of Carol's savings. If she loses the case, she faces bankruptcy. Richard was scheduled to testify next week with evidence that would likely end the case in his favor.

## Motive Assessment

**Financial**: Losing the lawsuit would bankrupt her
**Personal**: Deep hatred after years of legal fighting
**Immediate Threat**: Richard's testimony could have destroyed her case and reputation

## Alibi

Claims she went to use the restroom at 9:05 PM and returned at 9:25 PM - a 20-minute absence.

## Alibi Issues

- The nearest restroom is only 30 seconds from the parlor
- 20 minutes is an unusually long bathroom break
- She was seen by David Kim near the library hallway at approximately 9:15 PM
- Claims she "got lost" looking for a different restroom

## Statement

"Yes, Richard and I were enemies. But I'm not stupid enough to kill him right before my lawsuit is about to conclude. His death doesn't end the case - his estate can still testify using his documented evidence. I was in the restroom longer because I was composing myself. Seeing him again was difficult."

## Physical Evidence

- Wine glass found in library had lipstick matching the shade Carol was wearing
- Carol claims she never entered the library that evening

## Investigator Notes

Carol's explanation about the lawsuit is technically correct, but further investigation revealed she recently learned that Richard possessed a letter proving her fraud - evidence that would emerge at trial. His death before testimony might give her time to contest the letter's authenticity. She remained coldly calm during questioning.

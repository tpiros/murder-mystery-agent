# Suspect Profile: Alice Chen

## Personal Information
- **Age**: 38
- **Occupation**: Art dealer, owner of Chen Fine Arts
- **Relationship to Victim**: Business associate, creditor

## Financial Situation

Richard Thornwood owed Alice Chen approximately $280,000 for several art pieces she had sourced for him over the past year. He had been delaying payment, citing "cash flow issues" that Alice knew were fabricated.

## Motive Assessment

**Financial**: Significant debt owed to her
**Personal**: Publicly embarrassed by Richard at an art auction three months ago when he questioned the authenticity of a piece she was selling

## Alibi

Claims she went to her car at 9:15 PM to retrieve a gift for Richard. Was gone approximately 25 minutes. Her car was parked in the front drive, approximately 3 minutes walk from the house.

## Alibi Issues

- 25 minutes seems excessive for retrieving a small package from her car
- No witnesses can confirm she went to the car
- The gift she retrieved was a bottle of rare wine, which she could have brought in earlier

## Statement

"Richard and I had our disagreements, but he was a valuable client. Why would I kill someone who owes me money? Dead men don't pay debts. I was getting the wine from my car because I forgot it earlier - I was nervous about the evening."

## Physical Evidence

None directly linking her to the crime scene during the critical window.

## Investigator Notes

Alice appeared genuinely shocked at the news of Richard's death. Her financial motive is clear, but her logic about the debt is sound - his death complicates her chances of collection.

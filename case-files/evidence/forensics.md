# Forensic Report

## Case: TM-2024-0892
## Examiner: Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Chief Forensic Analyst

### Cause of Death

Blunt force trauma to the posterior skull. Single, forceful blow delivered from behind. Death was likely instantaneous.

### Time of Death

Based on body temperature and lividity: between 9:00 PM and 10:00 PM on October 15, 2024. Most likely around 9:20 PM.

### Murder Weapon

Bronze sculpture titled "The Thinker's Apprentice" (not the famous Rodin piece). Weight: 4.2 kg. Found on the floor near the body. Blood and hair samples match the victim.

**Fingerprints on weapon**: Smudged and partial. Multiple overlapping prints suggest the weapon was handled by several people over time, consistent with it being a displayed art piece. No clear prints from the night of the murder - killer likely wore gloves.

### Crime Scene Analysis

**Body Position**: Victim found face-down near his desk. He had been standing, likely examining something on his desk, when struck from behind.

**Signs of Struggle**: None. The attack was sudden and unexpected. The victim knew and trusted his attacker enough to turn his back.

**Items on Desk**:
- Open folder containing legal documents related to the Thompson lawsuit
- A torn piece of paper with partial handwriting
- An empty wine glass

### DNA Evidence

**Wine Glass**: Saliva DNA matches victim. However, lipstick traces found on rim belong to a female. Lipstick shade analysis pending.

**Under Victim's Fingernails**: No foreign DNA - confirms no struggle.

### Trace Evidence

**Carpet Fibers**: Fresh mud traces found near the library's French doors. Pattern indicates someone entered from the garden within hours of the murder.

**Perfume Residue**: Faint traces of "Midnight Rose" perfume detected near the body. This is a distinctive, expensive fragrance.

### Conclusion

The killer was someone the victim knew and trusted. They likely entered through the library door, struck while the victim's back was turned, and exited the same way. The attack was premeditated based on the apparent use of gloves.

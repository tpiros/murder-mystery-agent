# Evidence Report: Murder Weapon

## Item Description

Bronze sculpture, "The Thinker's Apprentice"
- Artist: Unknown, 19th century
- Weight: 4.2 kg (9.3 lbs)
- Height: 28 cm (11 inches)
- Estimated Value: $35,000

## Location Found

On the floor of the library, approximately 1.5 meters from the victim's body. The sculpture was normally displayed on a pedestal near the library's French doors.

## Physical Evidence

### Blood Evidence
- Type matches victim (A+)
- Splatter pattern indicates a single, powerful swing
- Blood concentrated on the base of the sculpture

### Hair and Tissue
- Samples recovered match victim
- Consistent with blunt force impact

### Fingerprints
Multiple partial prints identified:
- Several belong to victim (expected, as owner)
- One partial print matches David Kim (explained by his duties cleaning/maintaining the collection)
- Remaining prints smudged beyond identification
- No fresh, clear prints - killer likely wore gloves

## Analysis

The sculpture's weight and solid construction made it an effective improvised weapon. Its position near the French doors suggests the killer may have selected it opportunistically upon entering.

However, the precise placement of the killing blow suggests the attacker knew exactly what they were doing. Medical analysis indicates the blow was struck at the optimal angle to cause immediate death - suggesting either anatomical knowledge or significant luck.

## Notable Detail

A small scratch was found on the sculpture's base that wasn't present in photographs from a gallery showing three weeks prior. Under microscopic examination, traces of navy blue thread were found in the scratch - possibly from the killer's clothing catching on the rough edge.

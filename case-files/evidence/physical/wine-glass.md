# Evidence Report: Wine Glass

## Item Description

Crystal wine glass found on victim's desk in the library.

## Contents

Residue indicates the glass contained red wine, consistent with the 2015 Château Margaux served at dinner.

## Fingerprints

- Victim's prints on the stem (expected)
- No other identifiable prints on the glass itself

## Lipstick Analysis

### Finding
Distinct lipstick mark on the rim of the glass, approximately 180 degrees from where the victim would have drunk.

### Color Analysis
Shade identified as "Crimson Passion" by Luxe Cosmetics, a specific deep red shade.

### Comparison to Suspects

Lipstick samples were collected from all female attendees:

- **Alice Chen**: Wearing "Coral Sunrise" (orange-pink shade) - **NO MATCH**
- **Carol Thompson**: Wearing "Crimson Passion" by Luxe Cosmetics - **MATCH**

## Implications

The wine glass with Carol Thompson's lipstick was found in the library. Carol Thompson stated in her interview that she "never entered the library that evening."

This physical evidence directly contradicts her statement.

## Defense Consideration

The glass could theoretically have been placed there before the party. However, the housekeeper confirmed she cleaned and polished all glassware in the library at 4:00 PM that afternoon, and the glass was not there at that time.

## DNA Confirmation

Saliva DNA from the rim was tested. Mixed sample shows:
- Primary: Matches victim (he drank from the glass)
- Secondary trace: Female DNA, pending full analysis

Preliminary markers suggest the secondary DNA is consistent with Carol Thompson's profile (final confirmation pending).

# Evidence Report: Muddy Shoes

## Items Recovered

Two pairs of shoes with mud traces were collected from suspects:

### Pair 1: Bob Martinez's Oxford shoes
- Brown leather oxfords
- Mud on soles and lower sides
- Mud appears fresh (same evening)

### Pair 2: Carol Thompson's low heels
- Navy blue, 2-inch heels
- Light mud traces on soles only
- Carol claimed she never went outside

## Soil Analysis

### Garden Soil Composition
Thornwood Manor garden has two distinct areas:
- **Front Garden**: Clay-heavy soil, lighter brown color, contains limestone fragments
- **Side Garden (near library)**: Loamy soil, darker brown, contains specific fertilizer compounds

### Bob Martinez's Shoes
- Soil matches **Front Garden** composition
- Clay content and limestone fragments consistent with the path from front door to gazebo
- **Does NOT match** the side garden near library French doors

### Carol Thompson's Shoes
- Soil matches **Side Garden** composition
- Contains the specific fertilizer compounds used only on that section
- Pattern indicates walking on grass (impressions of grass blades in mud)
- **Matches** the area directly outside the library French doors

## Significance

Bob Martinez's alibi of smoking in the front garden is **SUPPORTED** by evidence.

Carol Thompson claimed she never went outside, yet her shoes contain mud specifically from the garden path leading to the library's exterior entrance.

## Weather Note

Light rain occurred between 8:00 PM and 8:30 PM on October 15th, making the garden paths muddy. Anyone walking outside during the critical window would have picked up mud on their shoes.

## Additional Finding

One partial shoe print was recovered from the soft ground outside the library French doors. The print size and tread pattern are consistent with Carol Thompson's heels.

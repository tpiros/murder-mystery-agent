# Evidence Report: Torn Letter Fragments

## Item Description

Partially torn letter found on victim's desk. Several pieces recovered, others missing.

## Recovered Text

Fragment 1 (largest piece):
```
...will not let you destroy everything I've built. If you
testify next week, I swear I will make you regret it. You
know what I'm capable of. This is your last warning...
```

Fragment 2:
```
...the evidence you claim to have is fabricated and you
know it. I never defrauded anyone - you set me up from
the beginning. But I have proof now...
```

Fragment 3:
```
...meet me at the manor. We need to settle this before
the trial. Come alone. Tell no one...
```

High-quality linen stationery. Watermark matches paper stock used by "Executive Impressions," a high-end stationery shop. Purchase records show Carol Thompson has an account there and purchased this paper type in the last 6 months.

## Fingerprints

- Victim's prints on all fragments
- One partial print on Fragment 1 matches Carol Thompson

## Investigator Notes

This letter appears to be a threatening correspondence from Carol Thompson to the victim. The reference to "the trial" and "testimony" aligns with their ongoing lawsuit. The threat is explicit: "I will make you regret it."

The letter also reveals Carol planned to meet Richard privately at the manor - something she denied in her initial statement, claiming she was invited to the dinner party like everyone else.

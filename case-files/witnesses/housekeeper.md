# Witness Statement: Margaret Wilson

## Witness Information
- **Name**: Margaret Wilson
- **Age**: 58
- **Occupation**: Housekeeper at Thornwood Manor (12 years)
- **Interview Date**: October 15-16, 2024

## Statement

"It was a strange evening from the start. Mr. Thornwood was more anxious than I'd ever seen him. He kept checking his watch and looking toward the door, like he was expecting something.

The dinner was tense. Ms. Thompson and Mr. Thornwood barely spoke, but you could cut the tension with a knife. When they did look at each other, it was pure ice.

After dinner, everyone went to the parlor except Mr. Thornwood. He said he needed to get something from the library. That was the last time I saw him alive.

I was mostly in the kitchen cleaning up. David Kim - poor thing, I never understood why Richard fired him - came to talk to me around 9 o'clock. He was upset about his severance. We talked for maybe 20 minutes, then I went to check if the dining room was cleared properly. When I came back, he was gone.

At 10:15, I thought I should offer drinks to the guests still in the parlor. The library door was closed, and Mr. Thornwood hadn't come out. I knocked and got no answer. When I opened the door... God, I'll never forget it."

## Key Observations

### About the Suspects

**Carol Thompson**: "She was wearing a beautiful navy blue dress. Very expensive looking. I noticed she seemed different when she came back from the restroom - more composed, if you know what I mean. Almost calmer."

**Bob Martinez**: "He was nervous all night. Kept fidgeting. But he's always been that way around his uncle. Richard was hard on the boy."

**Alice Chen**: "Professional as always. She and Richard argued at dinner, but that's normal for them. Business people."

**David Kim**: "Such a sweet young man. Richard firing him made no sense. David was devoted to him."

## Additional Note

"Oh, one thing - I noticed Ms. Thompson's shoes had mud on them when she came back from the restroom. I thought it was odd because the restroom is inside, isn't it?"

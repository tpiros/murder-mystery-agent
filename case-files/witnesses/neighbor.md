## Statement

"I was walking my dog, Biscuit, that evening around 9 o'clock. We usually take the path that runs along the edge of Richard's property.

As I passed the side garden, I saw a figure near those big glass doors - the ones that lead to Richard's library. It was dark, but the library light was on, so I could see a silhouette. It looked like a woman, based on the build and the way she moved. She was standing there, looking in, for maybe a minute or so.

I thought it was odd, but it's not my business what goes on at Richard's parties. I kept walking. Biscuit was eager to get home - he doesn't like the dark.

Oh, and I heard something when I was further along. A thud, maybe? I didn't think much of it at the time. Old houses make noises. But now, knowing what happened... it might have been around 9:15 or 9:20. Biscuit and I are usually home by 9:30, and we were almost back by then."

## Key Points

- Witnessed a female figure near library French doors around 9:00-9:10 PM
- Figure appeared to be observing from outside
- Heard a "thud" around 9:15-9:20 PM
- Did not recognize the individual

## Investigator Assessment

Mr. Greene is a reliable witness with no connection to any suspects. His timeline aligns with the estimated time of death. The female figure he observed could have been Carol Thompson, whose alibi places her away from the parlor during this exact window.

# Witness Statement: James Chen (Phone Interview)

## Witness Information
- **Name**: James Chen
- **Age**: 45
- **Relationship**: Business partner of Alice Chen (her brother), not present at manor
- **Interview Date**: October 17, 2024

## Statement

"I wasn't at the dinner, but Alice called me that afternoon. She was worried about seeing Richard. He owed us a lot of money, and she was planning to confront him about it.

But she also told me something interesting. She said Carol Thompson had contacted her a few days before, asking about Richard's schedule and whether Alice was invited to any events at the manor. Alice thought it was strange but told her about the dinner party.

Carol and Richard's feud is well-known in our circles. Everyone knew she blamed him for destroying her reputation. Lately, she'd been acting desperate. The lawsuit wasn't going well for her - Richard had some kind of evidence that would prove she'd been embezzling, not him.

The night of the murder, Alice texted me at 9:40 PM. She said the evening was uncomfortable and she wanted to leave. She was waiting for an appropriate moment.

I know my sister. She's tough in business, but she wouldn't hurt anyone. Carol Thompson, though - I've seen the way she looks at Richard. Pure hatred."

## Key Points

- Carol Thompson sought information about Richard's schedule before the event
- Carol was described as acting "desperate" recently
- The lawsuit evidence was apparently damning for Carol
- Provides context for Carol's motive and premeditation

## Evidence Provided

- Text message records confirm Alice texted James at 9:40 PM
- Carol's inquiry about Richard's schedule corroborated by Alice's phone records showing missed call from Carol on October 12

## Investigator Notes

This testimony suggests Carol Thompson may have been specifically seeking an opportunity to confront or harm Richard. Her inquiry about his schedule, combined with her presence at the dinner and the threatening letter, suggests premeditation.
